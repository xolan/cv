# xolan/cv

HTML cv template.

## Dependencies

To use SCSS you need [Ruby](http://rubyinstaller.org/) and [SASS](http://sass-lang.com/). You can however ignore the SCSS-file if you prefer to work with plain CSS.

I've provided a java program for converting to pdf. See WebToPdf for details.
